# Guinness chocolate cake

A lot of Guinness cake recipes just taste like chocolate cake and not Guinness-y at all. Because this one makes a Guinness reduction first, it actually tastes like Guinness.

## Ingredients
* Guinness Extra Stout
* 125 grams all-purpose flour 
* 45g cocoa powder (I'm a fan of Hershey's Special Dark)
* 1.5 teaspoons espresso powder
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 200 grams dark brown sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 eggs
* 8 oz sour cream
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Directions
1. Boil about half a bottle of Guinness on the stove. You need 1/2 cup of the reduction, but I made them with closer to 1/3 cup and could still clearly taste the Guinness deliciousness.
2. While it cools, beat the brown sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, sour cream, and vanilla into a smooth batter-like goodness. 
3. If you're fancy, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. If you're not feeling fancy, thanks to modern flour, you probably won't even notice the difference, so just dump it in there. But if you're a lazy person who doesn't mix dry ingredients separately, when you add the espresso powder, baking soda, and salt, be sure to sprinkle them around and not just dump them in. Nobody wants a mouthful of baking soda. 
4. Bake at 350Â°F for about 30 minutes. Exactly how long will vary depending on whether you're doing a whole cake or cupcakes or what. You know how to tell if a cake is done. Looks done? Stick comes out clean? Done!
8. Bam. Cake. Delicious. Eat.
