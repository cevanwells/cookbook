1. Place bacon in a deep saucepan and fry, covered, on low heat, for 10-20 minutes or until bacon is beginning to brown and most of the fat has rendered off.
1. Strain off excess fat, retain a small amount for frying leeks and bacon together

1. Cover and simmer on low until lentils are cooked, 45 minutes to 1 hour
1. Add more liquid as desired until you like the consistency. It works well as a soup or as a thick stew.

## Notes

* A lot of the salt in the bacon renders out with the fat, but it's still best to use unsalted or low-sodium broth, as your bacon may be saltier. 

* Roasted brussles sprouts are a great addition to this dish, add when about 20 minutes remain on the simmer.
