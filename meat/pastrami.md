## Instructions
1. Mix the cure ingredients and the distilled water. Stir until they dissolve.
1. Trim meat to a 1/8" fat layer on one side. if there is any filmy
   membrane on the other side, remove it all. [author] likes to buy a full packer
   brisket and separate the point from the flat, and cut the flat in half
   when making corned beef or pastrami. That gives [author] 3 manageable hunks
   of 2 to 4 pounds each. If you leave the point attached to the flat
   beneath, it will be very thick and take longer to cure, and there's an
   ugly hunk of fat between them. (Fattier point section is preferred for
   pastrami)
1. Add the meat to the curing solution. The meat will drink up brine
   so make sure there is enough to cover it by at least 1" or else you'll
   find the meat high and dry after a few days. Refrigerate. Let it swim
   for 5 days, up to 7, especially if the meat is more than 2"
   thick. Move the meat every day or so just to stir up the cure and
   ensure all sides of the meat get brined (no movement means the meat
   resting on the bottom does not get exposed to the brine). When you are
   done, the exterior of the meat will be pale tan or gray and if you cut
   into it, it should not look too different than normal raw meat, just a
   little pinker.
1. Desalinate. Put the corned beef in a pot slightly larger than the
   meat and cover it with cold water in the fridge for at least 8 hours
   (see Notes). This removes excess salt. Trust [author], you need to do this
   or you will be gulping water all night after your meal.
1. Rub. Make the rub by blending together all the spices. Rinse the
   meat, and while it is damp, apply the rub liberally, about 4
   tablespoons per square foot of surface, and press it into the surface
   to help it adhere. If there is a thin part of meat, use less rub. Put
   in the fridge for a minimum of 2 days. Don't wrap it. The rub just
   sticks to the plastic wrap. Normally [author] says you do not need to let
   meats marinate in a rub, but the wait seems to help this particular
   rub adhere.
1. Smoke. Set up your grill in 2 zones for smoking or set up your
   smoker. If you can, use a charcoal smoker. It produces a deeper darker
   crust than any other cooker. Preheat to 225째F. Pick your wood.
   [author] doesn't
   think it makes a huge difference with all the other flavors banging
   around in there. My best batch was with cherry wood.
1. Smoke it with indirect heat until it reaches the stall at about
   150째F. Remove and rest a couple hours. Wrap in foil and refrigerate
   for minimum 12 hours (or up to a week).
1. Steam. Do not slice the meat first. If the pan is steel don't let
   the foil touch the meat. Steam it an hour or two until heated through
   to 203째F. Don't rush this. Take it all the way to 203째F. The crust
   tends to get soft when you steam. No doubt about it, a hard crust is
   more appealing. So you can firm the crust by putting it on a hot grill
   or in the oven or under the broiler for a few minutes. The best crust
   comes from the full smoke.
1. Slicing. Slicing is crucial to maximize tenderness. Look at the
   meat and notice which way the grain is running. Cut it by hand in thin
   slices, about 1/8" thick, perpendicular to the grain. If you cut
   parallel to the grain it will be much chewier. Don't try to slice it
   with a machine. It will just fall apart.

## Notes
* Our August 2020 cook: started with 3.5 lbs of USDA Prime *point*
  (the flat was turned into 1) smoked brisket, and 2) coarse ground
  into Terlingua-style chili) ... we used commercial pickling spice
  for the brine ... we desalinated with a simple rinse
  rather than soak ... the smoker took about 2h45m to reach 159F
  before [Greg] pulled it (the higher temp doesn't seem to have affected
  it, as that was still *before* the stall (ie. no moisture boiled out
  and off the surface); [Greg] used my Primo smoker, with the interior
  ceramic plates to ensure no direct heat). The steam oven took about
  2h15m. ... Net weight: about XX lbs (we ate some before weighing).
